Description: Calculates the p-values of a family of statistics that test the association between specified genetic markers, called target markers, and a binary trait. The family includes the burden statistic, the linear kernel, statistic, a new case-based kernel statistic, and optimal ensembles formed by taking linear combinations of these three statistics. Allows imputed genotypes. New in this version: Uses one-segment-assign-many to create sampling sets.
